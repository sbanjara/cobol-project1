# COBOL Project 1

  This is a COBOL program which creates a salary report. It was the first project of my CS 370 (COBOL) class. The input file has the      information of an employee namely Warehouse id, employee id, position, name, hire date, starting salary, current salary, and date of last pay increase. It processes the input file as outlined in the **program1-description** file and outputs a salary report as outlined in **program1-printer-spacing-chart**. The input file and the output file along with other files are attached in this repository.
